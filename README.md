# Find-Nth-Fibonacci-Sequence
Write a block of MIPS code to compute the n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence,
defined as: <br />
Fibonacci(0) = 0 <br />
Fibonacci(1) = 1 <br />
Fibonacci(n) = Fibonacci(n - 1) + Fibonacci(n - 2) <br />
Write your solution under a MIPS label called Fibonacci; you may define other labels as needed.
Assume that the starting parameter n is given in register $a0, and place the result for Fibonacci(n)
in register $v0. You may use any registers for your solution as long as the values of registers $a0 and
$v0 correctly reflect n and Fibonacci(n) at the end.
